# CLASSICS
Project CLASSICS is an effort to analyze classic dishes for which
multiple renowned food authors have published a recipe.

CLASSICS was inpsired by ChefSteps' [Ultimate Guide to Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/the-ultimate-guide-to-chocolate-chip-cookies-let-s-begin-here),
which examined chocolate chip cookie recipes from some of my favorite names in food: Stella Parks, Grant Crilly (himself!), Kenji, Christina Tosi, and others.

I believe a similar method can be applied to other classic dishes as many of these share fairly standard preparation methods but differ in ingredient types and ratios.

Only one way to find out!
